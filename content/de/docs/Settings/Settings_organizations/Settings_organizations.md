The Organizations section of the Settings app is where you establish the categories you want to use to classify the contact people and contact information you add to an organization, as well as any types you may wish to use to classify the organization records for filtering purposes.


## Permissions

In order to interact with Organizations settings, a user needs to be assigned the following permissions:



*   **Settings (Organizations): Can view and edit settings.** This permission allows the user to view, create, edit, and delete all organizations settings.
*   **Settings (Organizations): View settings.** This permission allows the user to view, but not interact with, organizations settings.

You can assign permissions to users in the Users app.


## Settings \> Organizations \> Categories

Categories are a way to classify the contact people and contact information you add to an organization. Categories are defined by your library and can be used to group contact information and contact people to make them easier to find and identify. You need to first add the categories in the Settings app in order to assign them to organization contacts.

For more information on adding contact information and contact people to organizations, see [Contact information]({{< ref "/organizations.md#contact-information" >}}) and [Contact people]({{< ref "/organizations.md#contact-people" >}}).

## Settings \> Organizations \> Types
Libraries may create controlled lists of organization types to facilitate filtering based on the nature of the library's relationship with the organization, e.g. Subscription agent, consortium. An organization may have multiple types assigned to its record. This value can also be exported within the Orders CSV, when applied to selected vendors.

### Creating a new type

1. Click **New**.
