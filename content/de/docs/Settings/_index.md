In FOLIO, libraries use the Settings app to configure apps according to each institution's unique needs. Most apps have associated settings in the Settings app, some of which are required and some of which are optional. However, some apps do not have explicitly associated settings, and some settings do not have explicitly associated apps, but are meant to support configuration for FOLIO as a whole.

Some settings have effects across multiple apps.  For example, inventory settings for material types are used in circulation rules and are visible in loan records in Check Out and Users.
