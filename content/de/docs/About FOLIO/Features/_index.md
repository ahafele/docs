The FOLIO LSP includes the domains that support the libraryâ€™s operations such as circulation, acquisitions, cataloging, and e-resources management. Each domain is comprised of multiple, smaller apps (for example a check-in or checkout app within the circulation domain). For example, features include the ability to:

* Manage the library inventory including cataloging and bibliographic management functions
* Manage vendors, budgets, orders, and invoicing when acquiring materials
* Manage electronic resources including holdings, licenses, and agreements
* Manage users including library staff, faculty, and students
* Support different patron types, loan types, fines and fees structures, recalls, holds, and various reporting functions
* Circulate items and define circulation rules including loan, fines, notices, and requests policies
* Manage data import and export
