If you just want to try FOLIO without installing it, you can run one of the pre-built Vagrant boxes. 
![FOLIO Vagrant Box](/img/vagrant_boxes.png)

If you are a developer, you can get a FOLIO installation up and running quickly using a pre-built Vagrant box.  These virtual machines have a Single server installation of FOLIO running.  The Stripes and Okapi services can be accessed via port forwarding. You can create new modules on the host operating system and connect them to Okapi using a host only network that allows bidirectional connections between the host and the guest operating system.

At least 24 GB memory are needed to run the folio/release or folio/snapshot Vagrant box.

Please see https://dev.folio.org/tutorials/folio-vm/ for detailed instructions how to run a Vagrant box.
